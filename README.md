# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, hosted on **GitHub Pages**!

This website is a prime example of **learning by doing**, where I built my skills in web design and development through practical experience. The project taught me the **importance of the development process**, from wireframing to prototyping and deployment, as well as the critical role of **responsive design** to ensure accessibility across devices.

Feel free to explore the case studies and see my journey as a UX/UI designer!
