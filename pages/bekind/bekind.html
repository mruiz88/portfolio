                Finally we started the final project. After some comings and goings, BeKind was settled as our client for this 
                project. BeKind is (in 2023) a very early stage organization that wants to develop a digital online marketplace 
                to connect companies and individuals who want to donate all kinds of items with NGOs and Charities that would 
                give those items a second life. This platform is intends to contibute to the circular economy, to reducing waste 
                and saving the environment.
            </p>

            <div class="project__img project__img-small">
                <a href="./assets/concept.png" data-lightbox="image-1">

                <p class="project__img-caption"></p>
            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                We started by conducting a kick-off meeting with BeKind to get to know each other and know a little bit more 
                about their project and the challenge they were presenting us to be solved.<br><br>

                It seems that BeKind is at a very early stage of their development, as they are currently searching for investors, 
                but they lacked any visual idea of how their donations platform would be or look, although they had a very thorough 
                market analysis and a list of possible organisations that could benefit from their platform a lot. They provided 
                us with this valuable information and others that would smooth the start of this project.
            </p>

            <h2 class="project__subtitle project_5__subtitle">Empathize</h2>

            <p class="project__p">
                After this first meeting we started contacting Charities and NGOs to set meetings and interview them as potential 
                users for this app, from the perspective of the beneficiary of these donations as a user flow. In the meantime 
                when we waited for answers, we conducted some interviews with individual donors, people that are used to donating 
                items or are willing to do it, and some interesting insights came. It seems that although people are willing to 
                donate items the majority of them are not willing to pay for the transport of these items to the Charity 
                (specially required if the item you donate is big and you need to wire a moving company or rent a van for 
                example to do the trick).<br><br>

                Finally we managed to schedule some Charities/NGOs interviews with some members of those, and again very helpful 
                insights came up, but this time from the other side of the donation process. The main topic here was that although 
                is very helpful that people donate their items that don’t need anymore, they should conduct an initial filtering 
                thinking for each item if it is in a sufficient good condition to be used for others, so the donating process does 
                not become just another way to get rid of the things you do not want anymore.<br><br>

                We wanted to interview the last party in this process, that would be the donor companies, which tend to have a 
                slightly different donation process than the individual donors. We tried contacting them, but with the time we 
                had it was very difficult to schedule interviews. We managed to interview a former worker of a very big company 
                that is used to donating items and money to charities, but of course despite it being valuable information, it was 
                not primary information. We managed to contact the CEO of a British company that produces kitchens tools and 
                donates items that have little defects, enough to not be able to be sold, but still being ambe to be used. 
                It was a very short interview though, and we couldn’t get all the information we wanted from there to have all 
                the pictures for the company's donation process.

            <p class="project__p">
                After realizing that we did not have all the information we wanted for the Companies Userflow, we decided to focus 
                just on the Individual donors and Charities/NGOs User Flows for this project.<br><br>

                Paralelly to all the Interviews, we got to conduct some Secondary Research. For this, we focused on donations of material 
                items, not money and on Charities that sell second-hand items. We discovered that just a quarter of the items sent to 
                Charities shops is sold locally. The rest in the end has to be resold abroad, recicled or reprocessed into other things.<br><br>

                Additionally, to better understand how the other similar platforms worked, we analyzed them.

            <p class="project__p">
                First things first, we grouped all the insights we got from pur interviews in an Affinity Diagram, so we could clearly

                Next step was to define the Empathy Maps with all the information we got. In this project we needed two of them, one 
                for the Individual Donors and the other for the Charities/NGOs.

                Summarizing, we were able to identify the following <strong>pain points</strong> in which we could start working on:<br><br>
                <strong>Donors</strong>
                <ul class="indented">
                    <li>They receive useless items or items not in a good condition to be used.</li>
                    <li>They sometimes struggle to get specific items they need.</li>
                    <li>No warehouses, they have to reject some donations.</li>
                    <li>They sometimes do not have the means to get the items being donated.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <strong>Charities/NGOs</strong>
                <ul class="indented">
                    <li>Donating clothes could feel like putting them in the trash.</li>
                    <li>Finding a charity / place to donate can be hard.</li>
                    <li>Choosing what to donate is also hard.</li>
                    <li>Lack of clear information about the whole process, from what is needed to where does it go.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="project__p">
                Next step was to define our User Personas, as we dah allready all the information needed for that. We created two 
                User Personas, one for a Charity Worker, another for an Individual Donor, and finally we created a Lean User 
                Persona for a Company Worker with the little information we gathered on the matter and some assumptions we got 
                from the other parties involved.

                Following up, we built the User Journey Maps for Toni and Maria. For that we first tried to identify the journeys 
                each of them got, either trying to get the items they need or donate the items they don’t need anymore. After that 
                we identified the painpoints in each journey and consequently the opportunities that they offered us.

                Finally, with the Empathy Maps, User Personas and Journey Maps clearly defined, the last thing to do in the Define 
                step was to state our Problem Statements for Individual Donors and for Charities/NGOs.<br><br>
            </p>

            <p class="strong underline">Charities/NGOs Problem Statement</p>
                
            <p class="indented bitalic">
                “Charities and NGO’s need to find a way to get good quality items when they need them 
                because locating, sorting and storing items is difficult, expensive and time-consuming.”
            </p><br>

            <p class="strong underline">Individual Donors Problem Statement</p>

                “People who have material items to give away need to find a way to donate them in a quick

            </p>
            
            <h2 class="project__subtitle project_5__subtitle">Ideate</h2>

            <p class="project__p">
                In this step we started brainstorming and creating possible solutions for our users problems. To be honest, on the 
                Define part of the process we already had some ideas, and even a clear sketch of how this platform should be. But 
                nonetheless, we created some Crazy 8s to see if more ideas and possible features could come up.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                After that, we created a MOSCOW Map. There we added the requirements from our Client, the ideas that came up 
                from the Crazy 8s, and all the things we thought of during the process. The platform we were going to design was 
                beginning to take shape.

            <p class="project__p">
                Later, we worked on our Minimum Viable Product, making it clear what the minimum qualities and features would be
                 for our product to work. It is below.

                <p class="bitalic indented">“Be Kind is a web platform that connects individuals and companies who want to donate 
                    and charities and NGO’s, with specific registration processes, allowing users to filter, locate and claim the 
                    items being donated, set up alerts or wishlists, and notificating the donors when the item has been chosen.”
                </p>
                <br>
                With all these ideas clear in mind, we started thinking about how the Site Map could look like. We had clearly 
                that at this point, at least two User Flows were necessary, so we added to the Site Map two different Sign Up/Log 
                in processes. 
                <br><br>
                All site content would be accesible to view for not logged in users, but to actually use the service, a Sign Up 
                process will be required.

                And as mentioned above, two different Userflows were required for this project, as at least we needed two different

                With all the ideas plainly in our minds, the next step finally was to start prototyping. For it, we both created 
                a Low-fi prototype. We put them in common, explained it and used the best parts of each to create a final Low-fi 
                prototype, ready to be tested.
            </p>

            <div class="project__img project__img-small">

                    <img src="./assets/low-fi.png" alt="low fis">
                </a>
                <p class="project__img-caption"></p>
            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                For it we conducted some Concept Testing. A lot of useful insights came up from that, below are some of them.
            </p>

            <div class="project__img project__img-small">
                <a href="./assets/concept_testing.png" data-lightbox="image-1">

                </a>
                <p class="project__img-caption"></p>
            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                Some of the insights we got that we implemented in our Mid-Fi were for instance the reception of positive feedback 
                once you have uploaded a new item or when you accept the claim of a Charity/NGO. We received as well some insights 
                to improve the usability of the website, relocating elements or making them more obvious to the user.
                <br><br>
                For our Mid-fi Prototype, we used all the insights we got from Concept Testing. We refined it and relocated 
                some elements in the screens.
            </p>
            
            <div class="project__img project__img-small">

                    <img src="./assets/mid-fi.png" alt="mid-fi">

                <p class="project__img-caption">Some screens of our Mid-Fi</p>
            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                Now it was time for Usability Testing. In this stage we iterated a lot. It was the stage where the prototype evolved 
                more, using valuable insights that we got in our tests. Some of the users found missing some features that considered 
                mandatory in a platform like this. For example the ability to rate or report users, to ensure a minimum of quality 
                in its functioning, as well as to regulate the possible abuses that could occur during the exchange of items.
                <br><br>
                Another key feature that we forgot about is the ability to check the Charity/NGO that claimed your item before accept 
                the exchange, to ensure that their values agree with those of the donor.

            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                The next step was to start thinking of our Hi-Fi Prototype, and to build a Style for it. The first thing we did fot 
                it was to think about our Brand Attributes and to  build a Moodboard that expressed them.
            </p>

            <div class="project__img project__img-small">
                <a href="./assets/moodboard.png" data-lightbox="image-1">
                    <img src="./assets/moodboard.png" alt="moodboard">
                </a>
                <p class="project__img-caption">Moodboard made collaboratively between us</p>
            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                We tested the moodboard, and the testees gave almost the exact attributes that we got, so we started thinking of 
                our Style Tile.
                <br><br>
                We wanted a clear yet modern Typography for our platform, so we agreed to use the <strong>Satoshi</strong> Font Family. 
                <br><br>
                Choosing the colors was not so easy. Initially after several attempts we agreed to use the <span class="italic">Navy Blue</span> 
                we used at the end and a <span class="italic">Grass Green</span>. We had a meeting with the client to approve these colors, and 
                they told us that they did not exactly reflect what they envisioned for their platform, so we had to change them. At the end we added 
                <span class="italic">Turquoise</span> and <span class="italic">Yellow</span> to <span class="italic">Navy Blue</span>, thus creating 
                the colors of the brand. 
            </p>

            <div class="project__img project__img-small">

                <p class="project__img-caption">Final Style Tile</p>
            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                At this point, we could begin to apply our style to the Mid-fi. This was a slow and tedious process, in which even after 
                some additional usability tests we made some changes in usability issues, since we realized that some elements did not 
                have a clear hierarchy that affected the user flow. After a lot of changes and improvements we came up with our Hi-Fi 
                prototype.

            <h2 class="project__subtitle project_5__subtitle">Learnings</h2>

            <p class="project__p">
                In this project I learned a lot. It was the first project to work from the beginning to the end with a client, 
                and with various touch points and approvals during the process. This in the end proved to be encouraging but 
                challenging as well.<br><br>

                Additionally, this was the first project I worked in which several user personas and user flows were involved, 
                so it was more demanding. Advancing through the project we had to have in mind  at all times that everything we 
                settled affected at least two types of users, so it was more difficult to advance, but more rewarding to see that 
                everything fell into place in the end. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="project__subtitle project_5__subtitle">Next Steps</h2>

            <p class="project__p">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Throughout this project, we had a hard time not being able to obtain the necessary information to create 
                        the Userflow for the companies in time. So the next step would be to schedule interviews with companies 
                        that are used to donate items to charity and develop this third Userflow.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        The second thing that we have been longing to do but we haven't had enough time for that either is to 
                        create the mobile and tablet versions, or at least provide some screens to have a clear idea of how it 
                        would look.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Last but not least we want to implement more features that we thought of during the process and re-iterate
                         this current version and conduct more usability testing.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2 class="project__subtitle project_5__subtitle">Conclusion</h2>

            <p class="project__p">
                This has been our last Ironhack project, but also, in my opinion, the most fruitful and the one I'm most proud of. 
                We have been able to deal with a client who, although he was kind and understanding throughout the project, also 
                had very clear ideas about the direction he wanted the project to take. It is satisfying though, to see that in 
                the end, after the difficulties and the short delivery time, all the pieces fit and that the result is satisfactory 
                and even beautiful.
                <br><br>
                I have to thank my teammate Irina, who proved to be a very good project partner, useful and understanding. I think 
                we worked perfectly together.
                <br><br>
                I hope you enjoyed reading this case study and in any case, thank you for reading it.
