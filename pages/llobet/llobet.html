                Beginning my stage in <strong>E2S Creativa</strong> as a web designer, I had the opportunity to design the website for <strong>Llobet</strong>, a local retail food company. 
                Llobet operates multiple supermarkets in central Catalonia and has been expanding into related market niches, such as home food delivery 
                and the sale of prepared dishes. <br><br>

                The result of Llobet's expansion into new market niches is a diverse series of services offered to final clients. These services were 
                going well for them, but they wanted to use all this potential to expand to other fields. Their natural direction for this expansion was 
                to offer their services to companies.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                To achieve this, their services had to be bundled and offered to them effectively, in this case using a new website. Since most services 
                already had their own platforms, the new website was designed to act as a bridge, connecting them all. This central hub aimed to position 
                Llobet as the definitive tool for corporate gastronomic solutions, streamlining access to its diverse offerings.

                This is where <span class="bitalic">Llobet Empreses</span> (Llobet Companies) was created. Thanks to this website, service packages and contracts could be offered to 
                companies allowing workers from various companies to benefit from Llobet's services quickly and conveniently. From quickly delivering 
                fresh daily lunches for workers to elaborate catering for the most demanding corporate events.<br><br>

                My role in the project was to guide the client through the process, from the first kickoff meeting to the developer handling of the coded 
                and published website, initially designing a usable wireframe, then designing the final deliverable design using the existing company 
                style guide and bridging the gap between the developer and the client.

                <ul class="indented">
                    <li>Llobet aimed to create a platform that consolidated all their existing services into a single, accessible site tailored for 
                        business clients. <strong>The goal was to make it easy for users to find all the services they needed</strong> while ensuring the 
                        site was properly indexed by Google as a business service provider.</li>
                    <li>To achieve this, Llobet provided an initial structure for the website, which included a homepage dedicated to explaining their 
                        business philosophy as Llobet Empreses and promoting their services to potential corporate clients, and two market verticals in 
                        the sitemap, <strong>What can we offer to you?</strong> (<span class="bitalic">Qu√® et servim?</span> in Catalan), a market vertical that includes all the services that they can offer 
                        directly to companies or their workers and <strong>Contracts</strong> (<span class="bitalic">Contractes</span> in Catalan), for the services they offer that require prior 
                        contracting of these. This clear segmentation ensured that users could easily navigate and access the specific services they 
                        needed.</li>
                    <li>Finally, Llobet wanted <strong>a dedicated landing page for each service</strong>. These pages needed to clearly explain the individual services 
                        to the users, incorporating several call-to-action (CTA) elements to prompt users to contact Llobet for more information or to 
                        redirect them to the relevant pre-existing service pages. This approach aimed to enhance user engagement and streamline access 
                        to Llobet's various offerings.</li>

            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                After the kick-off meeting, I established regular communication with Enric, the head of marketing at Llobet. This direct link of 
                communication proved crucial to validating the next steps and completing the project within the timeline.<br><br>

                Given the tight schedule and given that the client specifically requested a desktop-focused design, I started the design process in the 
                desktop viewport. This allowed me to prioritize and deliver a detailed and fully functional desktop experience for this phase.

                To provide a valid wireframe I had to deeply understand each service my client provided or advertised on their website. 
            </p>

            <p class="project__p">
                <ul class="indented">
                    <li>Some services consisted of a direct order from the worker using a form on the web, like the order for punctual food.</li>
                    <li>Others, on the other hand, required formal hiring by the management of the client company, for example hiring a caterer for a 
                        corporate event. </li>
                    <li>Finally, other services, as I have already mentioned, functioned as showcases for services that already have an order process 
                        landing for individuals on their corporate website (but which could now also be used by companies and therefore also needed a 
                        landing on <span class="bitalic">Llobet Empreses</span>). These type simply function as a redirection bridge to the existing services.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="project__p">
                All this required prior knowledge to create a web structure suitable for the usability of each service landing.<br><br>
                With the basic briefing and Enric‚Äôs requests, I drafted an initial wireframe.

            <h2 class="project__subtitle project_6__subtitle">Application of Style</h2>

            <p class="project__p">
                The preexisting Llobet design, designed and developed at E2S Creativa as well, is the following.
            </p>

            <div class="project__img project__img-small">
                <a href="./assets/style_tile.jpg" data-lightbox="image-1">

                <p class="project__img-caption">Llobet Empreses Style Tile</p>
            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                <strong style="color: #708473;">Color</strong><br><br>

                The main color of <span class="italic">llobetonline.cat</span> (the main website of Llobet) is <strong style="color: #696058;">#696058</strong>, 
                a pale brown. To differentiate but still link their two brands, I used as a main color Llobet‚Äôs secondary color, <strong style="color: #C7BB74;">#C7BB74</strong>, 
                a yellowish beige, and <strong style="color: #3F3F3C;">#3F3F3C</strong>, a grayish black I user as a black.<br>

                Additionally, Llobet‚Äôs original branding have a color palette that act as a ‚Äúaccent palette‚Äù, a group of pastel colors that decorate different 
                elements. I used them to give some color specially to the iconography.

            </p>

            <p class="project__p">
                <strong style="color: #708473;">Typography</strong><br><br>

                The typography was still <span class="bitalic">Poppins</span>, as it is the main typography in all Llobet‚Äôs branding.
            </p>

            <p class="project__p">
                <strong style="color: #708473;">Iconography</strong><br><br>

                Given that almost the entire website was based on concepts and products are explained mostly in text, I wanted to give iconography a 
                predominant role on the website, reinforcing the ideas that the paragraphs expressed.
            </p>

            <h2 class="project__subtitle project_6__subtitle">Hi-Fi Prototype Design</h2>

            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                With all the design system defined, I started applying the style to the wireframe. For it, the client provided all the written content, 
                including the product descriptions and claims.<br><br>

                My design relied heavily on images, since being an online service and besides mostly selling food, it had to be very visual. The client had 
                some content for it, but not all, so we agreed that we would use stock photos for the content they could not provide, specially for the 
                situational images showing final clients enjoying their products.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                In this phase the design the approval was a bit more organic. First of all I applied style to the whole wireframe and booked a meeting with the 
                client to verify that the path was correct and aligned with the company objectives, so we did not have an ‚Äúapproval meeting‚Äù. The revisions and 
                changes were made along the way, but overall the client was satisfied with the result.<br><br>

            <p class="project__p">
                For this website, E2S Creativa relied on Guillem, a freelance developer who works for them on many projects of this scope. As this webpage had 
                to be self-manageable for the client, I created a handoff meeting with Enric, Guillem, and myself, so that all parties involved were informed 
                of everything from the beginning.<br><br>

                This website would be developed using WordPress so that the client could manage and update it himself without the need for programming knowledge.
                <br><br>
                Guillem created a testing environment on his local hosting so that I could see the progress in the web programming. For my part, my work went 
                to quality control, ensuring that the final result was adjusted as closely as possible to the design approved by the client. To make things 
                easier for Guillem, I created a shared document in which I added the comments so that he could apply them as he went along.<br><br>

                Additionally assisted Guillem in adapting these elements for the mobile version, ensuring the client's primary objective was met while 
                maintaining a responsive design without having a proper design file specifically for the mobile version. This collaborative approach ensured a 
                seamless user experience across all devices.

            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                After Guillem applied all my comments and the adaptation to mobile was satisfactory, we held another 3-way meeting with Enric, the client. 
                Enric had some additional commentaries, like the fact that we would like to add the logos of companies that were already using the service, 
                a practice that is currently quite widespread on the pages of B2B service companies. Apart from this and some other minor comments that 
                Guillem amended or changed accordingly very fast, Enric was overall satisfied with the result.
