                One of the most exciting projects I did in <strong>E2S Creativa</strong> was the web design for <strong>Girona Fibra</strong>, a telecommunications company from the Spanish province of 
                Gironès, part of the Spanish telecommunications group Avatel.

                Avatel recently acquired Girona Fibra, and despite being a company very rooted in its area, they didn't have a website up to par, so we were commissioned to 
                redesign it along with a complete marketing campaign.

            <p class="project__p">
                The schedule was tight, as Girona Fibra was to become a new sponsor for Basket Girona Club the next season, which was two months from then. The Girona Fibra 
                logo would be visible everywhere at the matches, so their new website would have to be already published and properly working.<br><br>

                As a <span class="italic">E2S Creativa</span>’s web designer, my role was to think, design, and hand to the developers a valid web design for the new Girona Fibra website.
            </p>

            <h2 class="project__subtitle project_7__subtitle">Briefing Keylines</h2>

            <p class="project__p">
                We did a kick-off meeting with Avatel's marketing department which gave me the following briefing:
                <ul class="indented">
                    <li>They needed a design for the new Girona Fibra website, mobile and desktop viewports. They had their in-house developers, and given the little time we 
                    had, my work was to develop a highly detailed design so they could develop it as fast as possible.</li>

                    <li>Girona Fibra already had corporate branding, and they wanted to keep it. Therefore, I had to preserve the logo, colors, fonts, 
                    and other elements that already existed and were used in other applications.</li>
                    
                    <div class="project__img project__img-smaller">
                        <a href="./assets/sitemap.png" data-lightbox="image-1">
                            <img src="./assets/sitemap.png" alt="girona fibra site map">
                        </a>
                        <p class="project__img-caption">Girona Fibra proposed site map</p>
                    </div>

                    <li>The <strong>sitemap</strong> they imagined was the following:<br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Home</strong> page with a header (mainly to show featured plans and promotions), a summary of plans, and promotional banners.</li>
                            <li>Their plans, which were divided into <strong>Fiber</strong> and <strong>Fiber + Phone</strong> should have specific landing pages.</li>
                            <li><strong>About us</strong> page.</li>
                            <li><strong>Contact</strong> page.</li>
                            <li><strong>News</strong> page.</li>
                            <li><strong>Legals</strong> page.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>The entire contracting process would be carried out by telephone, so the CTAs that the website would contain led to the same contact form, where the 
                    user would specify which rate was of interest and the Girona Fibra agents would contact the user later.</li>
                    
                    <li>There was an existing customer online platform, so the user had to have easy access to it at all times. Their contact e-mail and Whatsapp number had 
                    to be visible as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="project__subtitle project_7__subtitle">Competitive Analysis</h2>

            <p class="project__p">
                After the kick-off meeting and with all the information I had, the logical next step was to study the competitors, for structure, features, and other 
                elements.<br><br>

                I decided to analyze the websites of 3 of the biggest telecommunications companies in Spain, Vodafone, Movistar, and Orange. I decided to analyze these 
                pages focusing especially on the structure and the properties that these offer.

            <h2 class="project__subtitle project_7__subtitle">Wireframe Design Process</h2>
            
            <p class="project__p">
                I extracted a lot of information from my Competitor's Analysis, and with it and the briefing information, I started drafting a mid-fi wireframe, to start 
                defining a basic structure.<br><br>

                From the Competitor’s Analysis draw certain conclusions. Although 2 of 3 of the analyzed competitors had a single landing page for each plan, these mostly 
                worked as a product page to be purchased, with an “extras configurator” before contracting the actual plan. As in Girona Fibra all the plan contracts are 
                made on the phone and the extras were contracted along the phone contracting process, for me it made more sense to keep the plan landing pages to category 
                pages (Fiber and Fiber + Phone).<br><br>

                My main premise was to keep things simple, so I tried to extract the structural philosophy of the pages I analyzed and adapt it to the reality of Girona 
                Fibra, an operator with fewer rates and promotions than its competitors, which allowed for a cleaner structure and intuitive.
            </p>

            <div class="project__img project__img-small">
                <a href="./assets/mid-fi_1.png" data-lightbox="image-1">
                    <img src="./assets/mid-fi_1.png" alt="initial mid-fi screens">

                <p class="project__img-caption">Initial Mid-fi Screenshots</p>
            </div>

            <ul class="indented">
                <li>On the Home page, I decided to have a carousel header, as it has more flexibility than a static header. Below I would place the Plan Cards showing the available 
                    plans divided by the two existing categories.</li>
                <li>As all the plan contracting was to be made by phone, I placed a contact form on the bottom of each page, so it would be easy for the user to find it and contact 
                    Girona Fibra after reading all the information about their desired plan.</li>
                <li>As I acknowledged that it was a common practice and it would help the web positioning, I placed a drop-down FAQs section below each Category landing, to be filled 
                    with relevant and helpful information for the user.</li>
                <li>Additionally, as the briefing stated, I placed a contact button (that would lead to the contact page) and contact information, which would be always visible.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="project__p">
                After finishing my Mid-fi draft I booked a meeting with Girona Fibra marketing department. They found the mid-fi wireframe very pertinent and aligned with 
                their needs, just made some helpful observations:
            </p>

            <ul class="indented">
                <li>They wanted a better segmentation and a more visual solution for the two categories on the Homepage.</li>
                <li>They wanted to add an extras section on the Fiber + Phone page.</li>
                <li>They wanted a more visual solution for reason selector on the Contact page as well.</li>
            </ul>

                <p class="project__img-caption">Amended Mid-fi Screenshots</p>
            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                I decided to solve the Homepage and Contact page problem similarly implementing an animated selector that would act as a switch to change categories. 
                Finally, I added cards for the extras part to maintain the design consistent.<br><br>

                With all these changes applied, I could move forward to applying the style to my Mid-fi and creating a Hi-Fi prototype.

            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                As I commented before, Girona Fibra already had a kind of corporate design system, wish although it was not very well defined, It sat some bases in 
                color and typography that had to be respected.<br><br><br>

                <strong style="color: #2FB6BC;">Color</strong><br><br>

                The main color of Girona Fibra was #2FB6BC, a greenish blue (or bluish green, as you prefer ;) ). From this color, they used some gradients, 
                specially a 50%. Finally they used a sort of bluish black (#1A1A1A) as a Black color.<br><br><br>

                <strong style="color: #2FB6BC;">Typography</strong><br><br>

                Girona Fibra typography is <strong>Aalto Sans Pro</strong>, in different weights.<br><br><br>

                <strong style="color: #2FB6BC;">Iconography</strong><br><br>

                Apart from the “wireless waves icon”, Girona fibra didn’t have a preestablished icon system, so I created one. I wanted icons to represent the most 
                basic products a company in their field offered, but I wanted their shapes to be friendly and pleasing to the eye.<br><br><br>

                <strong style="color: #2FB6BC;">Images</strong><br><br>

                As I detected in my competitive analysis, the majority of telecommunications companies use many images of people, Avatel included, usually using 
                technological products or carrying out actions according to the slogan of the promotion of the moment. With the help of my studio colleagues, we 
                created images that met these requirements and were in line with the brand to be added on the website headers.
            </p>

            <h2 class="project__subtitle project_7__subtitle">Hi-Fi Design</h2>

            <p class="project__p">
                With the structure and style clear, I started to design the Hi-Fi prototype. In this stage, I started defining the Desktop viewport as well, since 
                it was only a rearrangement of the elements present in the mobile viewport in this case. Still, I relocated and resized always thinking of the 
                correct visualization and the correct legibility so that the final page could be responsive.<br><br>

                For this phase, Girona Fibra provided claims and texts for the promotions, headers, and About Us page, and I adapted my structure and graphic 
                elements to them.

            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                When I finished my design proposal, me and my colleagues arranged a meeting with Girona Fibra to show them the completed prototype in the two 
                viewports, mobile and desktop, along with all the other deliverables of the marketing campaign we are preparing for them.

            <p class="project__p">
                They appreciated the design and found it to be quite aligned with their needs and expectations. They did not require any major changes, so it was 
                time to prepare the file for the handoff to the developers.<br><br>

                From the beginning, I already took into account the limited time we had to deliver the design and their time to implement it, and since no further 
                collaboration with the developers was expected and required on my part while they were programming the website, I took charge of preparing a 
                well-commented and clear design file, with the two viewports well differentiated and with the styles well defined, so that for them it would be the 
                most understandable and the easiest to implement it.<br><br>

                The part of the design that was going to have to be updated most often would be the header carousel slides in the Home, so I created some templates 
                in which the creatives could be designed in three different sizes (or use these sizes to create them outside of Figma), so that these could be 
                adapted and displayed correctly in any viewport.
            </p>
            <p class="project__p">
                With this helper and some other tips, I believe that I created clear and concise deliverables, which contributed to a quick and correct coding of 
                the design without major impediments.<br><br>

            <strong style="color: #2FB6BC;">Conclusions</strong><br><br>

            <p class="project__p">
                The redesign project for Girona Fibra was a comprehensive and rewarding experience that showcased the importance of aligning design processes with 
                client needs and industry standards. By thoroughly understanding the client’s requirements, adapting design approaches to fit tight deadlines, and 
                maintaining consistency with existing branding, I was able to deliver a website that met both functional and aesthetic goals.<br><br>

                The iterative design process, guided by detailed feedback and collaborative efforts with the development team, allowed for continuous improvements 
                and refinements. The emphasis on responsive design principles ensured that the final product provided a seamless user experience across various 
                devices, which is crucial for today’s diverse digital landscape.<br><br>

                Ultimately, this project reinforced the value of clear communication, effective problem-solving, and meticulous quality assurance. The successful 
                launch of the Girona Fibra website not only enhanced their online presence but also solidified their position as a key player in the telecommunications 
                sector in the region. This experience has further honed my skills in web design, client collaboration, and responsive design, which I will continue 
                to apply to future projects.<br><br>
