                Starting our second project, new groups were arranged. The challenge was to <strong>design a responsive website for 
                    a local business or professional</strong>.<br><br>

                In this project we were introduced to the Stakeholder’s Interview. We were asked to find an e-commerce business
                interested in collaborating with us in this interview, and given tools to analyse the market around it.<br><br>

                Our chosen e-commerce was <strong>Amagi Boutique</strong>, a clothing e-commerce website that provides clothes for people who 
                want to actively fight for freedom, in various ways: freedom of speech, freedom to wear what you want, etc. 
                Their clothing is handcrafted, and some of the clothes have slogans in defense of freedom on them.

                Starting with the <strong>Empathize</strong> part of the Design Thinking process, we started conducting a 
                <span class="bitalic">Competitive Analysis</span> Analysis of businesses around this niche. We analysed some big
                brands’ websites, like ASOS or COS, and then some
                One-brand websites, more concerned and centered in certain topics, such as Patagonia, Nike or Vinted.

                After this part, we conducted the <strong>Stakeholder’s interview</strong>. Bjorna (the owner) is a super nice person who introduced 
                ourselves to her business very thoroughly. She had a clear idea of the values she wanted to transmit in her website. 
                Bjorna is a very strong believer of freedom in all its forms. We could extract a lot of useful information from it, 
                about her goals and vision. With this we had a clearer idea of what our website should focus on.<br><br>

                After this first interview, we conducted <strong>5 User interviews</strong> to know about their experience using this kind of e-commerce
                or just their overall experience shopping online. We extracted a lot of useful information about how people usually shops
                online, what makes a good e-commerce in their opinion, and if they find important to check the brand values beforehand.

                “Millennial Online Shoppers need to find a way to buy from brands that meet their values because they want to make more informed decisions

            </p>

            <p class="project__p">
                In a parallel way, we studied the current <span class="bitalic">Sitemap</span> for Amagi Boutique, and added the new pages that came from

                After that we moved to <strong>Prototyping</strong>. First we conducted a <span crass="bitalic">Crazy 8s</span> exercise, specially to see what ideas we 
                had for the project and prioritize features for the MVP.

                To create our <span class="bitalic">Low-fi prototype</span>, in this project we take a slightly different approach. Each of us, trying to use all the 
                information gathered, came up with a viable low-fi prototype for our website. 
                We chose the best approach and combined our Low-fis to create a prototype to be <span class="bitalic">Concept Tested</span>.<br><br>
                The majority of insights we got from it were positive. We just adapted some minor elements directly to de Mid-fi.

            <p class="project__p">
                With all the information we got from the Concept Testing we built our Mid-Fi prototype. In order to test the usability of it, we conducted 5 <span class="bitalic">Usability Tests</span> 
                on it. First of all with Otti, our bootcamp colleague who we interviewed in the Empathize stage of the process. She gave us a lot of insights that 
                made us improve our prototype. After that we conducted two more tests with Stuart and Nuria, who gave us more insights about the website structure and overall feeling. 
                Finally we conducted two more tests with Alex and Yusleivy, completing our Usability tests and applying the insights we thought more useful, iterating our Mid-Fi prototype.

            <p class="project__p">
                At this point, we had to start thinking about the <span class="bitalic">Hi-fi prototype</span>, where style, color and typography would be added to our design. For this we had three exercises to conduct. 
                First of all we conducted a <span class="bitalic">Visual Competitive Analysis</span> where we analysed the features and overall feeling of our direct competitors. We 
                gathered our insights on this in the same file and then searched the resemblances with our website.

                <p class="project__img-caption">Visual Competitive Analysis</p>
            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                After this we figured out our <span class="bitalic">Brand Attributes</span>, and came up with these five that we think are the pinnacle of our project: <span class="bitalic">High-end, Artistic, Progressive, Rebellious, Free</span>.
                <br><br>
                Finally each of us had to express in their own ability and opinion what these Attributes meant for them in a <span class="bitalic">Moodboard</span>. Using Images, Quotes and in the end anything that helped to express our own vision was 
                to be placed in a board forming a cluster of sensations which expressed our feelings about this website.
                <br><br>
                Of course this is very subjective and personal, and the group came up with very different Moodboards. Each of us explained the “why” behind their choices and we finally voted on the most relevant to ours. 
                We ensembled a common Moodboard with the most voted and tested it with the entire class. It was a funny game. The Teacher Assistants placed all Moodboards in a collaborative file, with the Brand attributes 
                hidden. Other groups had to guess them in different sticky notes below during 2 minutes, and then the original Brand attributes were revealed. This way we knew if our Moodboard transmitted the same vibrations 
                and ideas that we had in mind.

            <p class="project__p">
                The next step was to define the <span class="bitalic">Style Tile</span> for our website. We analysed our Moodboard and extracted from there a palette of colors for each of us. We explained our color decisions and voted for the final palette. 
                Then moved on to the typography and other elements, this way defining our entire <span class="bitalic">Style Tile</span>.

            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                From there, we had all the tools ready to transform our Mid-fi to a Hi-fi consistently. All group members took part in applying the style and refining our Mid-Fi to transform it to Hi-fi.
                <br><br>
                When we finished our first Hi-Fi Iteration we performed <span class="bitalic">Desirability Tests</span> on our prototype. We asked our testers to describe the feelings our webpage transmitted them. The idea we wanted to convey, 
                that our webpage was an e-commerce but strongly attached to its values was not entirely achieved, as some of the testees pointed that this rebellion and energy that our page needed to stress more this rebellion and energy that our page needed, 
                and the choice of colours and tipography somehow blurred our message. From those insights we iterated our Style Tile and later Hi-fi prototype and conducted more tests. We kept on testing and iterating until we felt our prototype was ready.

                For the Tablet design we decided to keep the navigation buttons on the right, since they fit well as icons, so in this case the Hamburger menu would only contain the three buttons on the right of the navigation bar.

            <p class="project__p">
                In the future we will have to take into consideration the Stakeholder insights as well as the User insights.
                <ul class="indented">
                    <li> Constantly iterating our decisions based in the User insights (Initial Interviews, Concept Testing, Usability Testing and Desirability Testing) are crucial to produce a good product in the end.</li>

                    <li>Although it is hard, a UX/UI designer must be consistent and forus on the User insights during all the design process, from the initial User Interviews to the Hi-Fi Prototype.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2 class="project__subtitle project_2__subtitle">Next Steps</h2>

            <p class="project__p">
                From what we learned, iteration is really important. So we want to keep conducting tests to refine even more our product and and finish our prototype to make it fully functional in all the paths possible.
            </p>

            <h2 class="project__subtitle project_2__subtitle">Conclusions</h2>

            <p class="project__p">
                This was my second project in the Bootcamp. It was hard, but rewarding in the end. Without my incredible teammates Sara, Elleta and Claudia this project it would not have been possible. I am extremely grateful for the experience and knowledge that we shared together and I look forward to continue working with them. Again, there is a lot of room to improve in this project, but it showed me the whole design process, from the 
                Briefing to the Hi-Fi Prototype.<br><br>
                Thank you for your time.</p>
