            <p class="project__p">
                The following project was the third in Ironhack Bootcamp. This time we were to redesign a popular mobile app, 
                improving our UI skills and learning more about apps style and structure on the way. This project was to be 
                performed individually. After some inquiries and doubts, I was bold enough to choose <strong>Amazon app on Android</strong> for 
                this redesign. The reason behind this decision is that Amazon App is vast in screens, options and information, 
                so surely it could allow some room to make things differently.
            </p>

            <div class="project__img project__img-small">
                <a href="./assets/real_ui.png" data-lightbox="image-1">
                    <img src="./assets/real_ui.png" alt="current ui design of Amazon app in iOS">
                </a>
                <p class="project__img-caption"></p>
            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                I started choosing three screens to clone in Figma, in order to better understand the app and practice my UI 
                skills a bit, which is always good. I chose the Home page, Profile Result page and a Product page.<br><br>

                Cloning Amazon app screens, I realized that there is a clear lack of consistency in their design. Prices are 
                shown in 3 or 4 different ways, and there are dozens of different product cards, each with a font size, photo 
                size, different elements colocation and different card size. It really seems that Amazon doesn’t care a lot 
                about consistency in their design (not that they need it to be a recognizable app, luckily for them) but I feel 
                that they have added elements in different stages and updates, not taking in consideration the previous ones and 
                not having a clear Style Guide, ending with this hodgepodge of design.
            </p>

                <a href="./assets/card_gibberish.png" data-lightbox="image-1">
                    <img src="./assets/card_gibberish.png" alt="Amazon cards examples">

                <p class="project__img-caption">Some cards and prices examples of the current Amazon app</p>
            </div>
            
            <p class="project__p">
                When I had the app screens cloned, I conducted a <strong>Visual Competitive Analysis</strong>. I selected <span class="italic">Aliexpress, 
                Alibaba</span> and <span class="italic">Ebay</span> as direct competitors and analyzed their App overall style and design. First of all I 
                saw that white background and clean UI was a point to consider, as thousands of different pictures of 
                items of all colors possible would fill an app with these characteristics.<br><br>
                
                Another thing I realized is that even though some of them took care of some elements in a different and 
                maybe more efficient way, consistency was not a strong point for these apps. It seems that it is a consistent 
                problem in big online marketplaces. Maybe due to constant updates of the fact that thousands of elements 
                are shown there, it seems that they don't have too much consideration for consistency in their design in 
                general.

            <p class="project__p">
                After this brief research, I started thinking about my own design. So firstly, in order to put my ideas in order 
                and clarify the mood I wanted to transmit with my design, I chose my <span class="bitalic">Brand Attributes</span>, and from there, I 
                assembled a <span class="bitalic">Moodboard</span>.
            </p>

            <div class="project__img project__img-small">
                <a href="./assets/moodboard.png" data-lightbox="image-1">
                    <img src="./assets/moodboard.png" alt="moodboard">
                </a>
                <p class="project__img-caption">The Brand Attributes that Amazon most arouse in me and that in my opinion should reflect</p>
            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                And following some of the insights I got from people when they analyzed the Moodboard.
            </p>

            <div class="project__img project__img-smaller">
                <a href="./assets/moodboard_testing.png" data-lightbox="image-1">
                    <img src="./assets/moodboard_testing.png" alt="moodboard testing">

                <p class="project__img-caption">The Brand Attributes that Amazon most arouse in me and that in my opinion should reflect</p>

            <p class="project__p">
                Now the hard part began. I had to develop the new identity for Amazon, a massive corporation that probably spent 
                (and keep spending) thousands of dollars in their identity. I had to break all the standards of what people think 
                when they think about Amazon, I didn’t want to create a better identity, but to present an alternative that worked as 
                well. So I started thinking about the <span class="bitalic">Brand Colors</span>. When I thought about Fast I couldn’t help it to think about Flash, 
                the superhero about DC Comics, and his red suit.
            </p>

            <div class="project__img project__img-small">
                <a href="./assets/flash.jpg" data-lightbox="image-1">
                    <img src="./assets/flash.jpg" alt="picture of DC's superhero Flash">
                </a>
                <p class="project__img-caption"></p>
            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                So for me Fast was Red, but I didn’t want the Red people have always in mind when they think about this color 
                (Ferrari Red), so I went for a slightly different Red for my <span class="bitalic">Primary color</span>. For <span class="bitalic">Secondary color</span> I just had a 
                darker version of this colour, and for <span class="bitalic">Accent color</span> I went for a Pistachio, as I needed a colour that contrasted 
                well with my Red, and a Green could be an option. For <span class="bitalic">Neutral colors</span> I went for a Grays scale with this 
                “reddish” little percentage.
            </p>

            <div class="project__img project__img-small">

                </a>
                <p class="project__img-caption">Behold the new colors for Amazon!</p>
            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                The next step was to define the <span class="bitalic">Typography</span>. I wanted the design to be clean, geometrical and well organized, so I went for a 
                geometrical font named <span class="italic">Jost</span>.
            </p>

            <div class="project__img project__img-small">
                <a href="./assets/typography.png" data-lightbox="image-1">
                    <img src="./assets/typography.png" alt="Jost font">
                </a>
                <p class="project__img-caption"></p>
            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                Last but not least, I wanted to recreate the Amazon Logo as well. I am well aware of the Amazon logo story (Beginning at the “A” in “Amazon” 
                and ending at the “Z”, this design element of the Amazon logo is meant to portray the message that Amazon sells everything from “A” to “Z”). 
                But I wanted to do something different, always having this efficiency and quickness I wanted to transmit in my new identity. So I used Jost 
                font in capital letters to white “AMAZON” and used this arrow as well, but to point directly to the “O”, as if it were a target. This is the result.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                Finally, I could come up with a complete <span class="bitalic">Style Tile</span>, using the colours, typography and overall mood 
                I defined for this project.
            </p>

            <div class="project__img project__img-small">

                </a>
                <p class="project__img-caption"></p>
            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                The following was to solve the inconsistency problem in the Amazon current app. I simply defined a clear <span class="bitalic">Product Card system</span>, 
                well-structured and defined, ready to be used in every situation needed. For this, I defined two Product Card sizes and two “option” cards. An easy system 
                allowed to create any combination for a card with coupons, sales discounts and determine if it is a Prime product or not.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p class="project__p">
                With all this, I started the redesign itself. I wanted to keep in mind the Style Tile I chose, but also the clarity and 
                minimalism that, in my opinion, are necessary for a marketplace app.<br><br>

                In this way, I wanted to keep the white as much as possible, but trying to give depth to the elements so that the design 
                did not look too flat. On the other hand, the regularity of the product cards helped a lot to maintain the feeling of 
                organization and clarity, especially on the Home page. Additionally, the sections of the Profile Page looked much more 
                ordered this way too.<br><br>

                Finally, I didn't want to apply big design changes to the product page, just give a bit of consistency in the design and 
                use of colors.

            <p class="project__p">
                I learned a lot with this project. The best way to learn how to do a thing is to try it, and I wanted to do a lot of things 
                with this project and searched how to do it in Figma. This was definitely a good practice exercise. Of course, I don’t even 
                try to compete with Amazon designers here, but I feel satisfied with the result, trying to organize a bit the madness that 
                the Amazon World is.<br><br>

                Thank you very much for your time.
